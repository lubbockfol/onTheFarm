				After all this time I guess I finally made it through<br>
				All the darkness to the point of being over you<br>
				Now and then my mind runs into your old memory<br>
				But it ain't quite as big a deal as it used to be<br>
<br><br>
				Now I know even though you're not here<br>
				You will never be too far away<br>
				Anywhere, you'll be there<br>
				Like a whisper inside me each and every day<br>
				If I win, if I lose, you will always play a small part<br>
				Like a flame, you'll remain in<br>
				Your own little corner of my heart<br>
<br><br>
				I thought every kiss you gave me time would just erase<br>
				I waited for the day they'd disappear without a trace<br>
				Finally I realized that even though you're gone<br>
				There'll always be an ember of you burning on and on<br>
<br><br>
				Now I know even though you're not here<br>
				You will never be too far away<br>
				Anywhere, you'll be there<br>
				Like a whisper inside me each and every day<br>
				If I win, if I lose, you will always play a small part<br>
				Like a flame, you'll remain in<br>
				Your own little corner of my heart<br>
